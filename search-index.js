following section describes advanced deployment and configuration methods for the Che server component. The following section describes the Che server component advanced configuration method for a deployment. Advanced configuration is necessary to: Add environment variables not automatically generated by the Operator from the standard CheCluster Custom Resource fields. Override the properties automatically generated by the Operator from the standard CheCluster Custom Resource fields. The customCheProperties field, part of the CheCluster Custom Resource server settings, contains a map of additional environment variables to apply to the Che server component. Example 1. Override the default memory limit for workspaces Add the CHE_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT__MEMORY__LIMIT__MB property to customCheProperties: apiVersion: org.eclipse.che/v1 kind: CheCluster # ... spec: server: # ... customCheProperties: CHE_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT__MEMORY__LIMIT__MB: \"2048\" # ... Previous versions of the Che Operator had a ConfigMap named custom to fulfill this role. If the Che Operator finds a configMap with the name custom, it adds the data it contains into the customCheProperties field, redeploys Che, and deletes the custom configMap. Additional resources For the list of all parameters available in the CheCluster Custom Resource, see Understanding the CheCluster Custom Resource. For the list of all parameters available to configure customCheProperties, see Che server component system properties reference. The following document describes all possible configuration properties of the Che server component. API service. Browsers initiate REST communications to Che server with this URL. Default http://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/api API service internal network URL. Back-end services should initiate REST communications to Che server with this URL Default NULL Che WebSocket major endpoint. Provides basic communication endpoint for major WebSocket interactions and messaging. Default ws://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/api/websocket Che WebSocket major internal endpoint. Provides basic communication endpoint for major WebSocket interactions and messaging. Default NULL Your projects are synchronized from the Che server into the machine running each workspace. This is the directory in the machine where your projects are placed. Default /projects Used when Kubernetes-type components in a devfile request project PVC creation (Applied in case of unique and per workspace PVC strategy. In case of the common PVC strategy, it is rewritten with the value of the che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.quantity property.) Default 1Gi Defines the directory inside the machine where all the workspace logs are placed. Provide this value into the machine, for example, as an environment variable. This is to ensure that agent developers can use this directory to back up agent logs. Default /workspace_logs Configures environment variable HTTP_PROXY to a specified value in containers powering workspaces. Default empty Configures environment variable HTTPS_PROXY to a specified value in containers powering workspaces. Default empty Configures environment variable NO_PROXY to a specified value in containers powering workspaces. Default empty By default, when users access a workspace with its URL, the workspace automatically starts (if currently stopped). Set this to false to disable this behavior. Default true Workspace threads pool configuration. This pool is used for workspace-related operations that require asynchronous execution, for example, starting and stopping. Possible values are fixed and cached. Default fixed This property is ignored when pool type is different from fixed. It configures the exact size of the pool. When set, the multiplier property is ignored. If this property is not set (0, and placeholders (for example: che-workspace-). In that case, new namespace will be created for each user. Used by OpenShift infra as well to specify a Project. The or placeholder is mandatory. Default -che Defines whether che-server should try to label the workspace namespaces. Default true Defines whether che-server should try to annotate the workspace namespaces. Default true List of labels to find namespace that are used for Che Workspaces. They are used to: - find prepared namespace for users in combination with che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.annotations. - actively label namespace with any workspace. Default app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org,app.kubernetes.io/component=workspaces-namespace List of annotations to find namespace prepared for Che users workspaces. Only namespace matching the che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.labels will be matched against these annotations. namespace that matches both che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.labels and che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.annotations will be preferentially used for User’s workspaces. It’s possible to use placeholder to specify the namespace to concrete user. They are used to: - find prepared namespace for users in combination with che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.labels. - actively annotate namespace with any workspace. Default che.eclipse.org/username= Defines Kubernetes Service Account name which should be specified to be bound to all workspaces Pods. the Che Operator that Kubernetes Infrastructure will not create the service account and it should exist. OpenShift infrastructure will check if project is predefined(if che.infra.openshift.project is not empty): - if it is predefined then service account must exist there - if it is 'NULL' or empty string then infrastructure will create new OpenShift project per workspace and prepare workspace service account with needed roles there Default NULL Specifies optional, additional cluster roles to use with the workspace service account. the Che Operator that the cluster role names must already exist, and the Che service account needs to be able to create a Role Binding to associate these cluster roles with the workspace service account. The names are comma separated. This property deprecates che.infra.kubernetes.cluster_role_name. Default NULL Cluster roles to assign to user in his namespace Default NULL Defines wait time that limits the Kubernetes workspace start time. Default 8 Defines the timeout in minutes that limits the period for which Kubernetes Ingress become ready Default 5 If during workspace startup an unrecoverable event defined in the property occurs, stop the workspace immediately rather than waiting until timeout. the Che Operator that this SHOULD NOT include a mere \"Failed\" reason, because that might catch events that are not unrecoverable. A failed container startup is handled explicitly by Che server. Default FailedMount,FailedScheduling,MountVolume.SetUpfailed,Failed to pull image,FailedCreate,ReplicaSetCreateError Defines whether use the Persistent Volume Claim for Che workspace needs, for example: backup projects, logs, or disable it. Default true Defined which strategy will be used while choosing PVC for workspaces. Supported strategies: common: All workspaces in the same namespace will reuse the same PVC. Name of PVC may be configured with che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.name. Existing PVC will be used or a new one will be created if it does not exist. unique: Separate PVC for each workspace’s volume will be used. Name of PVC is evaluated as '{che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.name} + '-' + {generated_8_chars}'. Existing PVC will be used or a new one will be created if it does not exist. per-workspace: Separate PVC for each workspace will be used. Name of PVC is evaluated as '{che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.name} + '-' + {WORKSPACE_ID}'. Existing PVC will be used or a new one will be created if it doesn’t exist. Default common Defines whether to run a job that creates workspace’s subpath directories in persistent volume for the common strategy before launching a workspace. Necessary in some versions of Kubernetes as workspace subpath volume mounts are created with root permissions, and therefore cannot be modified by workspaces running as a user (presents an error importing projects into a workspace in Che). The default is true, but should be set to false if the version of Kubernetes creates subdirectories with user permissions. See: subPath in volumeMount is not writable for non-root users #41638 the Che Operator that this property has effect only if the common PVC strategy used. Default true Defines the settings of PVC name for Che workspaces. Each PVC strategy supplies this value differently. See documentation for che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.strategy property Default claim-che-workspace Defines the storage class of Persistent Volume Claim for the workspaces. Empty strings means \"use default\". Default empty Defines the size of Persistent Volume Claim of Che workspace. See: Understanding persistent storage Default 10Gi Pod that is launched when performing persistent volume claim maintenance jobs on OpenShift Default registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8-minimal:8.3-230 Image pull policy of container that used for the maintenance jobs on Kubernetes cluster Default IfNotPresent Defines Pod memory limit for persistent volume claim maintenance jobs Default 250Mi Defines Persistent Volume Claim access mode. the Che Operator that for common PVC strategy changing of access mode affects the number of simultaneously running workspaces. If the OpenShift instance running Che is using Persistent Volumes with RWX access mode, then a limit of running workspaces at the same time is bounded only by Che limits configuration: RAM, CPU, and so on. See: Understanding persistent storage Default ReadWriteOnce Defines if Che Server should wait workspaces Persistent Volume Claims to become bound after creating. Default value is true. The parameter is used by all Persistent Volume Claim strategies. It should be set to false when volumeBindingMode is configured to WaitForFirstConsumer otherwise workspace starts will hangs up on phase of waiting PVCs. Default true Defines annotations for ingresses which are used for servers exposing. Value depends on the kind of ingress controller. OpenShift infrastructure ignores this property because it uses Routes rather than Ingresses. the Che Operator that for a single-host deployment strategy to work, a controller supporting URL rewriting has to be used (so that URLs can point to different servers while the servers do not need to support changing the app root). The che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property defines how the path of the ingress should be transformed to support the URL rewriting and this property defines the set of annotations on the ingress itself that instruct the chosen ingress controller to actually do the URL rewriting, potentially building on the path transformation (if required by the chosen ingress controller). For example for Nginx ingress controller 0.22.0 and later the following value is recommended: {\"ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target\": \"/$1\",\"ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect\": \"false\",\\ \"ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout\": \"3600\",\"ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout\": \"3600\", \"nginx.org/websocket-services\": \"\"} and the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform should be set to \"%s(.*)\". For nginx ingress controller older than 0.22.0, the rewrite-target should be set to merely / and the path transform to %s (see the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property). See the Nginx ingress controller documentation for the explanation of how the ingress controller uses the regular expression available in the ingress path and how it achieves the URL rewriting. Default NULL Defines a recipe on how to declare the path of the ingress that should expose a server. The %s represents the base public URL of the server and is guaranteed to end with a forward slash. This property must be a valid input to the String.format() method and contain exactly one reference to %s. See the description of the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.annotations_json property to see how these two properties interplay when specifying the ingress annotations and path. If not defined, this property defaults to %s (without the quotes) which means that the path is not transformed in any way for use with the ingress controller. Default NULL Additional labels to add into every Ingress created by Che server to allow clear identification. Default NULL Defines security context for Pods that will be created by Kubernetes Infra This is ignored by OpenShift infra Default NULL Defines security context for Pods that will be created by Kubernetes Infra. A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a Pod. This is ignored by OpenShift infra. Default NULL Defines grace termination period for Pods that will be created by Kubernetes infrastructures. Default value: 0. It allows to stop Pods quickly and significantly decrease the time required for stopping a workspace. the Che Operator: if terminationGracePeriodSeconds have been explicitly set in Kubernetes recipe it will not be overridden. Default 0 Number of maximum concurrent asynchronous web requests (HTTP requests or ongoing WebSocket calls) supported in the underlying shared HTTP client of the KubernetesClient instances. Default values: max=64, and max_per_host:5. Default values are not suitable for multi-user scenarios, as Che keeps open connections, for example for command or ws-agent logs. Default 1000 Number of maximum concurrent asynchronous web requests per host. Default 1000 Max number of idle connections in the connection pool of the Kubernetes-client shared HTTP client. Default 5 Keep-alive timeout of the connection pool of the Kubernetes-client shared HTTP client in minutes. Default 5 Creates Ingresses with Transport Layer Security (TLS) enabled. In OpenShift infrastructure, Routes will be TLS-enabled. Default false Name of a secret that should be used when creating workspace ingresses with TLS. This property is ignored by OpenShift infrastructure. Default empty Data for TLS Secret that should be used for workspaces Ingresses. cert and key should be encoded with Base64 algorithm. These properties are ignored by OpenShift infrastructure. Default NULL Certificate data for TLS Secret that should be used for workspaces Ingresses. Certificate should be encoded with Base64 algorithm. This property is ignored by OpenShift infrastructure. Default NULL Defines the period with which runtimes consistency checks will be performed. If runtime has inconsistent state then runtime will be stopped automatically. Value must be more than 0 or -1, where -1 means that checks won’t be performed at all. It is disabled by default because there is possible Che Server configuration when Che Server doesn’t have an ability to interact with Kubernetes API when operation is not invoked by user. It DOES work on the following configurations: - workspaces objects are created in the same namespace where Che Server is located; - cluster-admin service account token is mounted to Che Server Pod. It DOES NOT work on the following configurations: - Che Server communicates with Kubernetes API using token from OAuth provider. Default -1 Name of the ConfigMap in Che server namespace with additional CA TLS certificates to be propagated into all user’s workspaces. If the property is set on OpenShift 4 infrastructure, and che.infra.openshift.trusted_ca.dest_configmap_labels includes the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true label, then cluster CA bundle will be propagated too. Default NULL Name of the ConfigMap in a workspace namespace with additional CA TLS certificates. Holds the copy of che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.src_configmap but in a workspace namespace. Content of this ConfigMap is mounted into all workspace containers including plugin brokers. Do not change the ConfigMap name unless it conflicts with the already existing ConfigMap. the Che Operator that the resulting ConfigMap name can be adjusted eventually to make it unique in namespace. The original name would be stored in che.original_name label. Default ca-certs Configures path on workspace containers where the CA bundle should be mounted. Content of ConfigMap specified by che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.dest_configmap is mounted. Default /public-certs Comma separated list of labels to add to the CA certificates ConfigMap in user workspace. See the che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.dest_configmap property. Default empty Comma separated list of labels to add to the CA certificates ConfigMap in user workspace. See che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.dest_configmap property. This default value is used for automatic cluster CA bundle injection in OpenShift 4. Default config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true Additional labels to add into every Route created by Che server to allow clear identification. Default NULL The hostname that should be used as a suffix for the workspace routes. For example: Using domain_suffix=, the route resembles: routed3qrtk.. It has to be a valid DNS name. Default NULL Initialize OpenShift project with Che server’s service account if OpenShift OAuth is enabled. Default true Docker image of Che plugin broker app that resolves workspace tools configuration and copies plugins dependencies to a workspace. The Che Operator overrides these images by default. Changing the images here will not have an effect if Che is installed using the Operator. Default quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-metadata-broker:v3.4.0 Docker image of Che plugin artifacts broker. This broker runs as an init container on the workspace Pod. Its job is to take in a list of plugin identifiers (either references to a plugin in the registry or a link to a plugin meta.yaml) and ensure that the correct .vsix and .theia extensions are downloaded into the /plugins directory, for each plugin requested for the workspace. Default quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-artifacts-broker:v3.4.0 Configures the default behavior of the plugin brokers when provisioning plugins into a workspace. If set to true, the plugin brokers will attempt to merge plugins when possible: they run in the same sidecar image and do not have conflicting settings. This value is the default setting used when the devfile does not specify the mergePlugins attribute. Default false Docker image of Che plugin broker app that resolves workspace tools configuration and copies plugins dependencies to a workspace Default Always Defines the timeout in minutes that limits the max period of result waiting for plugin broker.

Default .che/che-editor.yaml,.che/che-theia-plugins.yaml,.vscode/extensions.json Default Editor that should be provisioned into Devfile if there is no specified Editor Format is editorPublisher/editorName/editorVersion value. NULL or absence of value means that default editor should not be provisioned. Default eclipse/che-theia/latest Default Plug-ins which should be provisioned for Default Editor.

Grants users with the manageSystem permission additional permissions for getByKey, getByNameSpace, stopWorkspaces, and getResourcesInformation. These are not given to admins by default and these permissions allow admins gain visibility to any workspace along with naming themselves with administrator privileges to those workspaces. Default false Grant system permission for che.admin.name user. If the user already exists it’ll happen on component startup, if not - during the first login when user is persisted in the database. Default admin Workspaces are the fundamental runtime for users when doing development. You can set parameters that limit how workspaces are created and the resources that are consumed. The maximum amount of RAM that a user can allocate to a workspace when they create a new workspace. The RAM slider is adjusted to this maximum value. Default 16gb The length of time in milliseconds that a user is idle with their workspace when the system will suspend the workspace and then stopping it. Idleness is the length of time that the user has not interacted with the workspace, meaning that one of the agents has not received interaction. Leaving a browser window open counts toward idleness. Default 1800000 The length of time in milliseconds that a workspace will run, regardless of activity, before the system will suspend it. Set this property if you want to automatically stop workspaces after a period of time. The default is zero, meaning that there is no run timeout. Default 0 The total amount of RAM that a single user is allowed to allocate to running workspaces. A user can allocate this RAM to a single workspace or spread it across multiple workspaces. Default -1 The maximum number of workspaces that a user is allowed to create. The user will be presented with an error message if they try to create additional workspaces. This applies to the total number of both running and stopped workspaces. Default -1 The maximum number of running workspaces that a single user is allowed to have. If the user has reached this threshold and they try to start an additional workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The user will need to stop a running workspace to activate another. Default 1 The total amount of RAM that a single organization (team) is allowed to allocate to running workspaces. An organization owner can allocate this RAM however they see fit across the team’s workspaces. Default -1 The maximum number of workspaces that a organization is allowed to own. The organization will be presented an error message if they try to create additional workspaces. This applies to the total number of both running and stopped workspaces. Default -1 The maximum number of running workspaces that a single organization is allowed. If the organization has reached this threshold and they try to start an additional workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The organization will need to stop a running workspace to activate another. Default -1 Alias of the OpenShift identity provider registered in Keycloak, that should be used to create workspace OpenShift resources in OpenShift namespaces owned by the current Che user. Should be set to NULL if che.infra.openshift.project is set to a non-empty value. See: OpenShift identity provider Default NULL Url to OIDC identity provider server Can be set to NULL only if che.oidc.oidcProvider is used Default http://${CHE_HOST}:5050/auth Internal network service Url to OIDC identity provider server Default NULL The number of seconds to tolerate for clock skew when verifying exp or nbf claims. Default 3 Username claim to be used as user display name when parsing JWT token if not defined the fallback value is 'preferred_username' in Keycloak installations and name in Dex installations. Default NULL Base URL of an alternate OIDC provider that provides a discovery endpoint as detailed in the following specification Obtaining OpenID Provider Configuration Information Deprecated, use che.oidc.auth_server_url and che.oidc.auth_internal_server_url instead. Default NULL Keycloak realm is used to authenticate users Can be set to NULL only if che.keycloak.oidcProvider is used Default che Keycloak client identifier in che.keycloak.realm to authenticate users in the dashboard, the IDE, and the CLI. Default che-public URL to access OSO OAuth tokens Default NULL URL to access Github OAuth tokens Default NULL Use the OIDC optional nonce feature to increase security. Default true URL to the Keycloak Javascript adapter to use. if set to NULL, then the default used value is ${che.keycloak.auth_server_url}/js/keycloak.js, or /api/keycloak/OIDCKeycloak.js if an alternate oidc_provider is used Default NULL Set to true when using an alternate OIDC provider that only supports fixed redirect Urls This property is ignored when che.keycloak.oidc_provider is NULL Default false Configuration of OAuth Authentication Service that can be used in \"embedded\" or \"delegated\" mode. If set to \"embedded\", then the service work as a wrapper to Che’s OAuthAuthenticator ( as in Single User mode). If set to \"delegated\", then the service will use Keycloak IdentityProvider mechanism. Runtime Exception wii be thrown, in case if this property is not set properly. Default delegated Configuration for enabling removing user from Keycloak server on removing user from Che database. By default it’s disabled. Can be enabled in some special cases when deleting a user in Che database should execute removing related-user from Keycloak. For correct work need to set administrator username ${che.keycloak.admin_username} and password ${che.keycloak.admin_password}. Default false Keycloak administrator username. Will be used for deleting user from Keycloak on removing user from Che database. Make sense only in case ${che.keycloak.cascade_user_removal_enabled} set to 'true' Default NULL Keycloak administrator password. Will be used for deleting user from Keycloak on removing user from Che database. Make sense only in case ${che.keycloak.cascade_user_removal_enabled} set to 'true' Default NULL User name adjustment configuration. Che needs to use the usernames as part of Kubernetes object names and labels and therefore has stricter requirements on their format than the identity providers usually allow (it needs them to be DNS-compliant). The adjustment is represented by comma-separated key-value pairs. These are sequentially used as arguments to the String.replaceAll function on the original username. The keys are regular expressions, values are replacement strings that replace the characters in the username that match the regular expression. The modified username will only be stored in the Che database and will not be advertised back to the identity provider. It is recommended to use DNS-compliant characters as replacement strings (values in the key-value pairs). Example: \\\\=-,@=-at- changes \\ to - and @ to -at- so the username org\\user@com becomes org-user-at-com.

Both the Che central controller and user workspaces consist of a set of containers. Those containers contribute to the resources consumption in terms of CPU and RAM limits and requests. The Workspace Controller consists of a set of five services running in five distinct containers. The following table presents the default resource requirements of each of these services. Table 1. ControllerServices Pod Container name Default memory limit Default memory request Che Server and Dashboard che 1 GiB 512 MiB PostgreSQL postgres 1 GiB 512 MiB Keycloak keycloak 2 GiB 512 MiB Devfile registry che-devfile-registry 256 MiB 16 MiB Plug-in registry che-plugin-registry 256 MiB 16 MiB These default values are sufficient when the Che Workspace Controller manages a small amount of Che workspaces. For larger deployments, increase the memory limit. See the Advanced configuration options for the Che server component article for instructions on how to override the default requests and limits. For example, the Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat that runs on https://workspaces.openshift.com uses 1 GB of memory. Additional resources Che architecture. This section describes how to calculate the resources required for a workspace. It is the sum of the resources required for each component of this workspace. These examples demonstrate the necessity of a proper calculation: A workspace with ten active plug-ins requires more resources than the same workspace with fewer plug-ins. A standard Java workspace requires more resources than a standard Node.js workspace because running builds, tests, and application debugging requires more resources. Procedure Identify the workspace components explicitly specified in the components section of the devfile. Identify the implicit workspace components: Che implicitly loads the default cheEditor: che-theia, and the chePlugin that allows commands execution: che-machine-exec-plugin. To change the default editor, add a cheEditor component section in the devfile. The JWT Proxy component is responsible for the authentication and authorization of the external communications of the workspace components. Calculate the requirements for each component: Default values: The following table displays the default requirements for all workspace components, and the corresponding Che server properties. Use the Che server properties to modify the defaults cluster-wide. Table 2. Default requirements of workspace components by type Component types Che server property Default memory limit Default memory request chePlugin che.workspace.sidecar.default_memory_limit_mb 128 MiB 64 MiB cheEditor che.workspace.sidecar.default_memory_limit_mb 128 MiB 64 MiB kubernetes, openshift, dockerimage che.workspace.default_memory_limit_mb, che.workspace.default_memory_request_mb 1 Gi 200 MiB JWT Proxy che.server.secure_exposer.jwtproxy.memory_limit, che.server.secure_exposer.jwtproxy.memory_request 128 MiB 15 MiB Custom requirements for chePlugins and cheEditors components: Custom memory limit and request: Define the memoryLimit and memoryRequest attributes of the containers section of the meta.yaml file to configure the memory limit of the chePlugins or cheEditors components. Che automatically sets the memory request to match the memory limit if it is not specified explicitly. Example 1. The chePlugin che-incubator/typescript/latest meta.yaml spec section: spec: containers: - image: docker.io/eclipse/che-remote-plugin-node:next name: vscode-typescript memoryLimit: 512Mi memoryRequest: 256Mi This results in a container with the following memory limit and request: Memory limit 512 MiB Memory request 256 MiB How to find the meta.yaml file of chePlugin Community plug-ins are available in the Che plug-ins registry repository in folder v3/plugins/${organization}/${name}/${version}/. For non-community or customized plug-ins, the meta.yaml files are available on the local Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster at ${pluginRegistryEndpoint}/v3/plugins/${organization}/${name}/${version}/meta.yaml. For example, on a local Minikube cluster, the URL for the che-incubator/typescript/latest meta.yaml is http://plugin-registry-che.192.168.64.78.nip.io/v3/plugins/che-incubator/typescript/latest/meta.yaml. Custom CPU limit and request: Che does not set CPU limits and requests by default. However, it is possible to configure CPU limits for the chePlugin and cheEditor types in the meta.yaml file or in the devfile in the same way as it done for memory limits. Example 2. The chePlugin che-incubator/typescript/latest meta.yaml spec section: spec: containers: - image: docker.io/eclipse/che-remote-plugin-node:next name: vscode-typescript cpuLimit: 2000m cpuRequest: 500m It results in a container with the following CPU limit and request: CPU limit 2 cores CPU request 0.5 cores To set CPU limits and requests globally, use the following dedicated environment variables: CPU Limit CHE_WORKSPACE_SIDECAR_DEFAULT__CPU__LIMIT__CORES CPU Request CHE_WORKSPACE_SIDECAR_DEFAULT__CPU__REQUEST__CORES See also Advanced configuration options for the Che server component. Note that the LimitRange object of the Kubernetes namespace or OpenShift project may specify defaults for CPU limits and requests set by cluster administrators. To prevent start errors due to resources overrun, limits on application or workspace levels must comply with those settings. Custom requirements for dockerimage components Define the memoryLimit and memoryRequest attributes of the devfile to configure the memory limit of a dockerimage container. Che automatically sets the memory request to match the memory limit if it is not specified explicitly. - alias: maven type: dockerimage image: eclipse/maven-jdk8:latest memoryLimit: 1536M Custom requirements for kubernetes or openshift components: The referenced manifest may define the memory requirements and limits. Add all previously calculated requirements. Additional resources Che architecture. This section describes a Che workspace example. The following devfile defines the Che workspace: apiVersion: 1.0.0 metadata: generateName: nodejs-web-app- projects: - name: react-web-app source: type: git location: \"https://github.com/che-samples/react-web-app\" components: - type: chePlugin id: vscode/typescript-language-features/latest - type: dockerimage alias: nodejs image: quay.io/eclipse/che-nodejs12-community:ce0526f endpoints: - name: 'nodejs' port: 3000 mountSources: true This table provides the memory requirements for each workspace component: Table 3. Total workspace memory requirement and limit Pod Container name Default memory limit Default memory request Workspace theia-ide (default cheEditor) 512 MiB 512 MiB Workspace machine-exec (default chePlugin) 128 MiB 32 MiB Workspace vscode-typescript (chePlugin) 512 MiB 512 MiB Workspace nodejs (dockerimage) 1 GiB 512 MiB JWT Proxy verifier 128 MiB 128 MiB Total 2.25 GiB 1.38 GiB The theia-ide and machine-exec components are implicitly added to the workspace, even when not included in the devfile. The resources required by machine-exec are the default for chePlugin. The resources for theia-ide are specifically set in the cheEditor meta.yaml to 512 MiB as memoryLimit. The Typescript Visual Studio Code extension has also overridden the default memory limits. In its meta.yaml file, the limits are explicitly specified to 512 MiB. Che is applying the defaults for the dockerimage component type: a memory limit of 1 GiB and a memory request of 512 MiB. The JWT container requires 128 MiB of memory. Adding all together results in 1.38 GiB of memory requests with a 2.25 GiB limit.

Communications of Che components with external services such as proxies, source code repositories, and Identity Provider (Keycloak or RH-SSO) may require using TLS. Those communications require the use of TLS certificates signed by trusted Certificate Authorities. When the certificates used by Che components or by an external service are signed by an untrusted CA, it can be necessary to import the CA certificate in the Che installation so that every Che component will consider them as signed by a trusted CA. Typical cases that may require this addition are: When the underlying Kubernetes cluster that uses TLS certificates signed by a CA that is not trusted. When Che server or workspace components connect to external services such as Keycloak or a Git server that use TLS certificates signed by an untrusted CA. Che uses labeled ConfigMaps in namespace as sources for TLS certificates. The ConfigMaps can have an arbitrary number of keys with a random number of certificates each. On OpenShift, when the cluster contains cluster-wide trusted CA certificates added through the cluster-wide-proxy configuration, Che Operator detects them and automatically injects them into this ConfigMap: Che automatically labels the ConfigMap with the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=\"true\" label. Based on this annotation, OpenShift automatically injects the cluster-wide trusted CA certificates inside the ca-bundle.crt key of ConfigMap Some Che components require to have a full certificate chain to trust the endpoint. If the cluster is configured with an intermediate certificate, then the whole chain (including self-signed root) should be added to Che. The following procedure is applicable for already installed and running instances and for instances that are to be installed. Prerequisites The kubectl tool is available. Namespace for Che exists. Procedure Save the certificates you need to import, to a local file system. Certificate files are typically stored as Base64 ASCII files, such as .pem, .crt, .ca-bundle. But, they can also be binary-encoded, for example, as .cer files. All Secrets that hold certificate files should use the Base64 ASCII certificate rather than the binary-encoded certificate. Che already uses some reserved file names to automatically inject certificates into the ConfigMap, so you should avoid using the following reserved file names to save your certificates: ca-bundle.crt ca.crt Create a new ConfigMap with the required TLS certificates: $ kubectl create configmap custom-certs --from-file= -n=eclipse-che Add another -from-file= flag to apply more than one bundle. Otherwise, create another ConfigMap. Label created ConfigMaps with both app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org and app.kubernetes.io/component=ca-bundle labels: $ kubectl label configmap custom-certs app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org app.kubernetes.io/component=ca-bundle -n Deploy Che if it has not been deployed before. Otherwise wait until the rollout of Che components finishes. If there are running workspaces, they should be restarted for the changes to take effect. When something does not work as expected after adding the certificates, here is a list of things to verify: In case of a Che Operator deployment, the namespace where the CheCluster is located contains labeled ConfigMaps with the right content: $ kubectl get cm --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=ca-bundle,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org -n eclipse-che Check the content of ConfigMap by running: $ {orch-cli} get cm ____ -n {prod-namespace} -o yaml Che Pod Volumes list contains a volume that uses ca-certs-merged ConfigMap as data-source. To get the list of Volumes of the Che Pod: $ kubectl get pod -o json -n eclipse-che | jq .spec.volumes Che mounts certificates in folder /public-certs/ of the Che server container. This command returns the list of files in that folder: $ kubectl exec -t -n eclipse-che -- ls /public-certs/ In the Che server logs, there is a line for every certificate added to the Java truststore, including configured Che certificates. $ kubectl logs -n eclipse-che Che server Java truststore contains the certificates. The certificates SHA1 fingerprints are among the list of the SHA1 of the certificates included in the truststore returned by the following command: $ kubectl exec -t -n eclipse-che -- keytool -list -keystore /home/user/cacerts Your keystore contains 141 entries: + (...)

An installation of Minikube with Kubernetes version 1.19 or higher. See Installing Minikube. Procedure Start Minikube (it is important to allocate at least 4GB of RAM but 8GB are recommended): $ minikube start --addons=ingress --vm=true --memory=8192 This section describes how to install Che on Minikube using chectl. Prerequisites The chectl management tool is available. See Using the chectl management tool. A running instance of Minikube. See Using Minikube to configure Kubernetes. Procedure Run the following command: $ chectl server:deploy --platform minikube This section describes how to properly configure an LXC container for Minikube when the hypervisor uses ZFS, Btrfs, or LVM to provision the containers storage. Background The chectl command-line tool requires the Minikube Ingress plug-in to be enabled in Minikube. At the same time, the Minikube Ingress plug-in requires the Docker daemon to be running with the overlay filesystem driver. Problem According to Docker storage drivers, the Docker overlay2 driver is only supported with the Ext4 and XFS file systems (with ftype=1). Solution create a virtual block device inside a volume, which in the case of Btrfs is impossible and requires to use a file as the virtual block device. Procedure In the following instructions, change the zfsPool or LVM volume_group name and dockerstorage according to your use case and preferences. Create a fixed size ZFS dataset or LVM volume on the hypervisor side: $ zfs create -V 50G zfsPool/dockerstorage #USING ZFS $ lvcreate -L 50G -n dockerstorage volumegroup_name #USING LVM Use a partition tool to create a partition inside the virtual block device: $ parted /dev/zvol/zfsPool/dockerstorage --script mklabel gpt #USING ZFS $ parted /dev/zvol/zfsPool/dockerstorage --script mkpart primary 1 100% #USING ZFS $ parted /dev/mapper/volumegroup_name-dockerstorage --script mklabel gpt #USING LVM $ parted /dev/mapper/volumegroup_name-dockerstorage --script mkpart primary 1 100% #USING LVM Observe references called: For ZFS: dockerstorage-part1 inside the /dev/zvol/zfsPool directory For LVM: volumegroup_name-dockerstorage1 inside the /dev/mapper directory This is the partition of the virtual block device to be used to store /var/lib/docker from the LXC container. Format the virtual partition to XFS with the ftype flag set to 1: $ mkfs.xfs -n ftype=1 /dev/zvol/zfsPool/dockerstorage-part1 #FOR ZFS $ mkfs.xfs -n ftype=1 /dev/mapper/volumegroup_name-dockerstorage1 #FOR LVM Attach the virtual partition to the container (minikube is the name of the LXC container, dockerstorage is the name for the storage instance in LXC configuration): $ lxc config device add minikube dockerstorage disk path=/var/lib/docker \\ source=/dev/zvol/zfsPool/dockerstorage-part1 #FOR ZFS $ lxc config device add minikube dockerstorage disk path=/var/lib/docker \\ source=/dev/mapper/volumegroup_name-dockerstorage1 #FOR LVM Check the filesystem inside the container using the df command: $ df -T /var/lib/docker Use the following LXC configuration profile in the LXC container to allow it to run Minikube: config: linux.kernel_modules: ip_vs,ip_vs_rr,ip_vs_wrr,ip_vs_sh,ip_tables,ip6_tables,netlink_diag,nf_nat,overlay,br_netfilter raw.lxc: | lxc.apparmor.profile=unconfined lxc.mount.auto=proc:rw sys:rw lxc.cgroup.devices.allow=a lxc.cap.drop= security.nesting: \"true\" security.privileged: \"true\" description: Profile supporting minikube in containers devices: aadisable: path: /sys/module/apparmor/parameters/enabled source: /dev/null type: disk aadisable2: path: /sys/module/nf_conntrack/parameters/hashsize source: /sys/module/nf_conntrack/parameters/hashsize type: disk aadisable3: path: /dev/kmsg source: /dev/kmsg type: disk name: minikube After starting and setting up networking and the Docker service inside the container, start Minikube: $ minikube start --vm-driver=none --extra-config kubeadm.ignore-preflight-errors=SystemVerification","title":"Installing Che on Minikube","component":"docs","version":"stable","name":"installing-che-on-minikube","url":"/docs/stable/administration-guide/installing-che-on-minikube/","titles":[{"text":"Using Minikube to configure Kubernetes","id":"using-minikube-to-set-up-kubernetes_che"},{"text":"Installing Che on Minikube using chectl","id":"installing-che-on-minikube-using-chectl_che"},{"text":"Running Minikube inside an LXC container","id":"using-minikube-with-lxc_che"}]},"/docs/stable/administration-guide/installing-che-on-openshift-4-using-cli/":{"text":"This section describes how to install Che on OpenShift 4 with the chectl CLI management tool.

This is especially useful when a user wants to bind a persistent volume provided by a non-default provisioner. To do so, a user binds this storage for the Che data saving and sets the parameters for that storage. These parameters can determine the following: A special host path A storage capacity A volume mod Mount options A file system An access mode A storage type And many others Che has two components that require persistent volumes to store data: A PostgreSQL database. A Che workspaces. Che workspaces store source code using volumes, for example /projects volume. Che workspaces source code is stored in the persistent volume only if a workspace is not ephemeral. Persistent volume claims facts: Che does not create persistent volumes in the infrastructure. Che uses persistent volume claims (PVC) to mount persistent volumes. The Che server creates persistent volume claims. A user defines a storage class name in the Che configuration to use the storage classes feature in the Che PVC. With storage classes, a user configures infrastructure storage in a flexible way with additional storage parameters. It is also possible to bind a static provisioned persistent volumes to the Che PVC using the class name. Procedure Use CheCluster Custom Resource definition to define storage classes: Define storage class names To do so, use one of the following methods: Use arguments for the server:deploy command Provide the storage class name for the PostgreSQL PVC Use the chectl server:deploy command with the --postgres-pvc-storage-class-name flag: $ chectl server:deploy -p minikube -a operator --postgres-pvc-storage-class-name=postgress-storage Provide the storage class name for the Che workspaces Use the server:deploy command with the --workspace-pvc-storage-class-name flag: $ chectl server:deploy -p minikube -a operator --workspace-pvc-storage-class-name=workspace-storage For Che workspaces, the storage class name has different behavior depending on the workspace PVC strategy. Define storage class names using a Custom Resources YAML file: Create a YAML file with Custom Resources defined for the Che installation. Define fields: spec#storage#postgresPVCStorageClassName and spec#storage#workspacePVCStorageClassName. apiVersion: org.eclipse.che/v1 kind: CheCluster metadata: name: eclipse-che spec: # ... storage: # ... # keep blank unless you need to use a non default storage class for PostgreSQL PVC postgresPVCStorageClassName: 'postgres-storage' # ... # keep blank unless you need to use a non default storage class for workspace PVC(s) workspacePVCStorageClassName: 'workspace-storage' # ...

This section describes how to use the Prometheus to collect, store, and query metrics about the DevWorkspace operator. Prerequisites The devworkspace-controller-metrics service is exposing metrics on port 8443. The devworkspace-webhookserver service is exposing metrics on port 9443. By default, the service exposes metrics on port 9443. Prometheus 2.26.0 or later is running. The Prometheus console is running on port 9090 with a corresponding service and route. See First steps with Prometheus. Procedure Create a ClusterRoleBinding to bind the ServiceAccount associated with Prometheus to the devworkspace-controller-metrics-reader ClusterRole. Without the ClusterRoleBinding, you cannot access DevWorkspace metrics because they are protected with role-based access control (RBAC). Example 1.

Example 2. Private subnetwork in a cloud provider Create a proxy configuration allowing the traffic to leave the node to reach an external-facing Load Balancer. Che uses two registries: the plug-ins registry and the devfile registry. They are static websites publishing the metadata of Che plug-ins and devfiles. When built-in offline mode they also include artifacts. The devfile and plug-in registries run in two separate Pods. Their deployment is part of the Che installation. The devfile and plug-in registries The devfile registry The devfile registry holds the definitions of the Che stacks. Stacks are available on the Che user dashboard when selecting Create Workspace. It contains the list of Che technological stack samples with example projects. When built-in offline mode it also contains all sample projects referenced in devfiles as zip files. The plug-in registry The plug-in registry makes it possible to share a plug-in definition across all the users of the same instance of Che.

Che workspaces consist of Pods running in a cluster, and therefore, many images are required to support all languages and plug-ins that can be used for a workspace. In an offline deployment, these images must be made available to the Che server running in the cluster. Essential images Running any workspace requires these essential images: Table 1. Images essential to starting workspaces quay.io/eclipse/che-server The main Che server image quay.io/eclipse/che-postgres The database used by Che quay.io/eclipse/che-keycloak Keycloak Pod for user authentication quay.io/eclipse/che-jwtproxy JWT proxy image for enabling authentication between services. quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-artifacts-broker quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-metadata-broker Images for adding plug-ins to workspaces. quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry Plug-in registry that store information about plug-ins and the runtime containers they require. See Building an offline plug-in registry image. quay.io/eclipse/che-devfile-registry Devfile registry that stores descriptions of the sample projects and how to load them as workspaces through the Getting Started tab in the dashboard. See Building an offline devfile registry image. Workspace-specific images The images described in this section are required for running a workspace. Any one workspace uses a subset of the images below. It is only necessary to include the images that are used in workspaces created. For example, when using Che only for developing in Java, many images can be omitted. To avoid issues when only a subset of the images described in this section is needed, remove unnecessary plug-ins and devfiles when building custom registries. Plug-in sidecar images Many workspace plug-ins are run in sidecar containers to ensure their dependencies are available. The offline plug-in registry (see Building an offline plug-in registry image) includes a file with the list of all images referenced in its plug-ins. To get a list of images required for plug-ins, display this file: $ docker run -it --rm \\ --entrypoint cat /var/www/html/v3/external_images.txt In the example above, substitute for the image name and tag of the custom plug-in registry. Devfile base images Every Che workspace uses one or more base images, which contain the development dependencies for projects that are being built. To use the samples, Che pull these images from the references to them in the devfile registry. This is needed because the sample devfiles included in the devfile registry apply to images suited for this purpose. An offline devfile registry (see Building an offline devfile registry image) contains a file with the list of all images referenced in its devfiles: $ docker run -it --rm \\ --entrypoint cat /var/www/html/devfiles/external_images.txt In the example above, substitute for the image name and tag of the custom devfile registry.","title":"Preparing a restricted environment","component":"docs","version":"stable","name":"preparing-a-restricted-environment","url":"/docs/stable/administration-guide/preparing-a-restricted-environment/","titles":[{"text":"Understanding network connectivity in restricted environments","id":"_understanding_network_connectivity_in_restricted_environments"},{"text":"Understanding the Che registries","id":"understanding-the-che-registries_che"},{"text":"Building offline registry images","id":"building-offline-registry-images_che"},{"text":"Building an offline devfile registry image","id":"building-an-offline-devfile-registry-image_che"},{"text":"Building an offline plug-in registry image","id":"building-an-offline-plug-in-registry-image_che"},{"text":"Preparing a private registry","id":"preparing-a-private-registry_che"}]},"/docs/stable/administration-guide/preparing-the-installation/":{"text":"To prepare a Che installation, learn about Che ecosystem and deployment constraints: Supported platforms Che architecture Calculating Che resource requirements Understanding the CheCluster Custom Resource","title":"Preparing the installation","component":"docs","version":"stable","name":"preparing-the-installation","url":"/docs/stable/administration-guide/preparing-the-installation/","titles":[]},"/docs/stable/administration-guide/removing-user-data/":{"text":"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law enforces the right for individuals to have personal data erased.

Users can mount a secret that contains sensitive data in a workspace container. This reapplies the stored data from the secret automatically for every newly created workspace. As a result, the user does not have to provide these credentials and configuration settings manually. Do not mount secrets that you define in a devfile. The following section describes how to automatically mount a Kubernetes or OpenShift secret in a workspace container and create permanent mount points for components such as: Maven configuration, the settings.xml file SSH key pairs AWS authorization tokens Git credentials store file A Kubernetes or OpenShift secret can be mounted into a workspace container as: A file - This creates automatically mounted Maven settings that will be applied to every new workspace with Maven capabilities. An environment variable - This uses SSH key pairs and AWS authorization tokens for automatic authentication. SSH key pairs can also be mounted as a file, but this format is primarily aimed at the settings of the Maven configuration. The mounting process uses the standard Kubernetes or OpenShift mounting mechanism, but it requires additional annotations and labeling for a proper bound of a secret with the required Che workspace container. Kubernetes annotations and labels are tools used by libraries, tools, and other clients, to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to Kubernetes or OpenShift native objects. Labels select objects and connect them to a collection that satisfies certain conditions, where annotations are used for non-identifying information that is not used by Kubernetes or OpenShift objects internally. This section describes Kubernetes or OpenShift annotation values used in the process of Kubernetes or OpenShift secret mounting in a Che workspace. Annotations must contain items that help identify the proper mounting configuration. These items are: che.eclipse.org/target-container: Valid till the version 7.14.

When set to true, the secret mounts into all user’s containers of the Che workspace. When set to false, the secret does not mount into containers by default. The value of this attribute can be overridden in devfile components, using the automountWorkspaceSecrets boolean property that gives more flexibility to workspace owners. This property requires an alias to be defined for the component that uses it. che.eclipse.org/env-name: The name of the environment variable that is used to mount a secret. che.eclipse.org/mount-as: Describes if a secret will be mounted as an environmental variable or a file. Options: env or file. che.eclipse.org/-env-name: FOO_ENV: The name of the environment variable used when data contains multiple items. mykeyName is used as an example. che.eclipse.org/git-credential: 'true': The flag indicates that the secret contains Git credential file.","title":"Configuring user secrets","component":"docs","version":"stable","name":"configuring-user-secrets","url":"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/configuring-user-secrets/","titles":[]},"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/customizing-workspaces-components/":{"text":"To configure a workspace: Use a devfile meeting the latest devfile 2 specification.

'false' disables the mounting process until it is explicitly requested in a devfile component using the automountWorkspaceSecrets:true property. If the secret has more than one data key, declare an environment variable name using a _env-name annotation for each data key, as shown in the following example. In this example, you provision the myvalue and othervalue data key values, and the environment variable names, FOO_ENV and OTHER_ENV, into all workspace containers. apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: mvn-settings-secret annotations: che.eclipse.org/automount-workspace-secret: 'true' che.eclipse.org/mount-as: env che.eclipse.org/mykey_env-name: FOO_ENV che.eclipse.org/otherkey_env-name: OTHER_ENV labels: ... data: mykey: myvalue otherkey: othervalue The maximum length of an annotation name in a Kubernetes secret is 63 characters, of which 9 characters are reserved for a prefix that ends with /. This acts as a restriction for the maximum length of the key that can be used for the secret.","title":"Mounting a secret as an environment variable into a workspace container","component":"docs","version":"stable","name":"secret-as-a-variable","url":"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/secret-as-a-variable/","titles":[]},"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/selecting-an-ide/":{"text":"You can select your IDE at when starting a workspace: Eclipse Theia (default IDE) JetBrains IDE such as IntelliJ or PyCharm Visual Studio Code Additional resources See: https://theia-ide.org/docs/","title":"Selecting an IDE","component":"docs","version":"stable","name":"selecting-an-ide","url":"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/selecting-an-ide/","titles":[]},"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/troubleshooting-che/":{"text":"This section provides troubleshooting procedures for the most frequent issues a user can come in conflict with.

Tuning can reduce this start time. Depending on the options, administrators or users can do the tuning. This section includes several tuning options for starting workspaces faster or improving workspace runtime performance. Caching images with Image Puller Role: Administrator When starting a workspace, Kubernetes pulls the images from the registry. A workspace can include many containers meaning that Kubernetes pulls Pod’s images (one per container). Depending on the size of the image and the bandwidth, it can take a long time. Image Puller is a tool that can cache images on each of Kubernetes nodes. As such, pre-pulling images can improve start times. See Caching images for faster workspace start. Choosing better storage type Role: Administrator and user Every workspace has a shared volume attached. This volume stores the project files, so that when restarting a workspace, changes are still available. Depending on the storage, attach time can take up to a few minutes, and I/O can be slow. Installing offline Role: Administrator Components of Che are OCI images. Set up Eclipse Che in offline mode (air-gap scenario) to reduce any extra download at runtime because everything needs to be available from the beginning. See Installing Che in a restricted environment. Optimizing workspace plug-ins Role: User When selecting various plug-ins, each plug-in can bring its own sidecar container, which is an OCI image. Kubernetes pulls the images of these sidecar containers. Reduce the number of plug-ins, or disable them to see if start time is faster. See also Caching images for faster workspace start. Reducing the number of public endpoints Role: Administrator For each endpoint, Kubernetes is creating Kubernetes Ingress or OpenShift Route objects. Depending on the underlying configuration, this creation can be slow. To avoid this problem, reduce the exposure. For example, to automatically detect a new port listening inside containers and redirect traffic for the processes using a local IP address (127.0.0.1), the Che-Theia IDE plug-in has three optional routes. By reducing the number of endpoints and checking endpoints of all plug-ins, workspace start can be faster. CDN configuration The IDE editor uses a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve content. Check that the content uses a CDN to the client (or a local route for offline setup). To check that, open Developer Tools in the browser and check for vendors in the Network tab. vendors..js or editor.main.* should come from CDN URLs. Providing enough CPU resources Plug-ins consume CPU resources. For example, when a plug-in provides IntelliSense features, adding more CPU resources may lead to better performance. Ensure the CPU settings in the devfile definition, devfile.yaml, are correct: apiVersion: 1.0.0 components: - type: chePlugin id: id/of/plug-in cpuLimit: 1360Mi (1) cpuRequest: 100m (2) 1 Specifies the CPU limit for the plug-in. 2 Specifies the CPU request for the plug-in. Providing enough memory Plug-ins consume CPU and memory resources. For example, when a plug-in provides IntelliSense features, collecting data can consume all the memory allocated to the container. Providing more memory to the plug-in can increase performance. Ensure about the correctness of memory settings: in the plug-in definition - meta.yaml file in the devfile definition - devfile.yaml file apiVersion: v2 spec: containers: - image: \"quay.io/my-image\" name: \"vscode-plugin\" memoryLimit: \"512Mi\" (1) extensions: - https://link.to/vsix 1 Specifies the memory limit for the plug-in. In the devfile definition (devfile.yaml): apiVersion: 1.0.0 components: - type: chePlugin id: id/of/plug-in memoryLimit: 1048M (1) memoryRequest: 256M 1 Specifies the memory limit for this plug-in.","title":"Troubleshooting slow workspaces","component":"docs","version":"stable","name":"troubleshooting-slow-workspaces","url":"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/troubleshooting-slow-workspaces/","titles":[{"text":"Improving workspace start time","id":"improving-workspace-start-time_che"},{"text":"Improving workspace runtime performance","id":"improving-workspace-runtime-performance_che"}]},"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/using-developer-workspaces/":{"text":"Eclipse Che provides developer workspaces with everything you need to code, build, test, run, and debug applications: Project source code Web-based integrated development environment (IDE) Tool dependencies needed by developers to work on a project Application runtime: a replica of the environment where the application runs in production Pods manage each component of a Che workspace.

This section describes how to check important logs. Procedure In the OpenShift web console, click Applications → Pods to see a list of all the active workspaces. Click on the name of the running Pod where the workspace is running. The Pod screen contains the list of all containers with additional information. Choose a container and click the container name. The most important logs are the theia-ide container and the plug-ins container logs. On the container screen, navigate to the Logs section. This section describes how to detect memory problems related to a plug-in running out of memory. The following are the two most common problems related to a plug-in running out of memory: The plug-in container runs out of memory This can happen during plug-in initialization when the container does not have enough RAM to execute the entrypoint of the image. The user can detect this in the logs of the plug-in container. In this case, the logs contain OOMKilled, which implies that the processes in the container requested more memory than is available in the container. A process inside the container runs out of memory without the container noticing this For example, the Java language server (Eclipse JDT Language Server, started by the vscode-java extension) throws an OutOfMemoryException. This can happen any time after the container is initialized, for example, when a plug-in starts a language server or when a process runs out of memory because of the size of the project it has to handle. To detect this problem, check the logs of the primary process running in the container. For example, to check the log file of Eclipse JDT Language Server for details, see the relevant plug-in-specific sections. This section describes how to log the exchange between Che-Theia and a debug adapter into the Output view. Prerequisites A debug session must be started for the Debug adapters option to appear in the list. Procedure Click File → Settings and then open Preferences. Expand the Debug section in the Preferences view. Set the trace preference value to true (default is false). All the communication events are logged. To watch these events, click View → Output and select Debug adapters from the drop-down list at the upper right corner of the Output view.

Procedure Set the showLog attribute to true in the debug configuration. { \"version\": \"0.2.0\", \"configurations\": [ { \"type\": \"go\", \"showLog\": true .... } ] } To enable debugging output for a component, add the package to the comma-separated list value of the logOutput attribute: { \"version\": \"0.2.0\", \"configurations\": [ { \"type\": \"go\", \"showLog\": true, \"logOutput\": \"debugger,rpc,gdbwire,lldbout,debuglineerr\" .... } ] } The debug console prints the additional information in the debug console. This section describes how to view the Go logs output in the Output panel. Procedure Navigate to the Output view. Select Go in the drop-down list. No specific diagnostics exist other than the general ones. Procedure To enable the tracing of messages sent to the Typescript (TS) server, in the Preferences view, set the typescript.tsserver.trace attribute to verbose. Use this to diagnose the TS server issues. To enable logging of the TS server to a file, set the typescript.tsserver.log attribute to verbose. Use this log to diagnose the TS server issues. The log contains the file paths. This section describes how to view the Typescript language server log. Procedure To get the path to the log file, see the Typescript Output console: To open log file, use the Open TS Server log command. This section describes how to view the Typescript logs output in the Output panel. Procedure Navigate to the Output view Select TypeScript in the drop-down list. Other than the general diagnostics, there are Language Support for Java (Eclipse JDT Language Server) plug-in actions that the user can perform. Procedure Check if the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server main process. Open a terminal in the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in (an example name for the container: vscode-javaxxx). Inside the terminal, run the ps aux | grep jdt command to check if the Eclipse JDT Language Server process is running in the container. If the process is running, the output is: usr/lib/jvm/default-jvm/bin/java --add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM --add-opens java.base/java.util This message also shows the Visual Studio Code Java extension used. If it is not running, the language server has not been started inside the container. Check all logs described in Viewing Che workspaces logs. Procedure If the Eclipse JDT Language Server process is running, check if the language server features are working: Open a Java file and use the hover or autocomplete functionality. In case of an erroneous file, the user sees Java in the Outline view or in the Problems view. Procedure The Eclipse JDT Language Server has its own workspace where it logs errors, information about executed commands, and events. To open this log file, open a terminal in the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in. You can also view the log file by running the Java: Open Java Language Server log file command. Run cat where PATH_TO_LOG_FILE is /home/theia/.theia/workspace-storage//redhat.java/jdt_ws/.metadata/.log. Procedure To log the LSP messages to the Visual Studio Code Output view, enable tracing by setting the java.trace.server attribute to verbose. Additional resources For troubleshooting instructions, see the Visual Studio Code Java GitHub repository. Procedure To configure the PHP Intelephense language support to log the client-server communication in the Output view: Click File → Settings. Open the Preferences view. Expand the Intelephense section and set the trace.server.verbose preference value to verbose to see all the communication events (the default value is off). This procedure describes how to view Intelephense events in the Output panel. Procedure Click View → Output Select Intelephense in the drop-down list for the Output view. This procedure describes how to configure the PHP Debug plug-in to log the PHP Debug plug-in diagnostic messages into the Debug Console view. Configure this before the start of the debug session. Procedure In the launch.json file, add the \"log\": true attribute to the php configuration. Start the debug session. The diagnostic messages are printed into the Debug Console view along with the application output. Other than the general diagnostics, there are XML plug-in specific actions that the user can perform. Procedure Open a terminal in the container named vscode-xml-. Run ps aux | grep java to verify that the XML language server has started. If the process is running, the output is: java ***/org.eclipse.ls4xml-uber.jar` If is not, see the Viewing Che workspaces logs chapter. Procedure Check if the features are enabled. The XML plug-in provides multiple settings that can enable and disable features: xml.format.enabled: Enable the formatter xml.validation.enabled: Enable the validation xml.documentSymbols.enabled: Enable the document symbols To diagnose whether the XML language server is working, create a simple XML element, such as , and confirm that it appears in the Outline panel on the right. If the document symbols do not show, ensure that the xml.documentSymbols.enabled attribute is set to true. If it is true, and there are no symbols, the language server may not be hooked to the editor. If there are document symbols, then the language server is connected to the editor. Ensure that the features that the user needs, are set to true in the settings (they are set to true by default). If any of the features are not working, or not working as expected, file an issue against the Language Server. Procedure To log LSP messages to the Visual Studio Code Output view, enable tracing by setting the xml.trace.server attribute to verbose. Procedure The log from the language server can be found in the plug-in sidecar at /home/theia/.theia/workspace-storage//redhat.vscode-xml/lsp4xml.log. This section describes the YAML plug-in specific actions that the user can perform, in addition to the general diagnostics ones. This section describes how to verify the state of the YAML language server. Procedure Check if the container running the YAML plug-in is running the YAML language server. In the editor, open a terminal in the container that is running the YAML plug-in (an example name of the container: vscode-yaml-). In the terminal, run the ps aux | grep node command. This command searches all the node processes running in the current container. Verify that a command node **/server.js is running. The node **/server.js running in the container indicates that the language server is running. If it is not running, the language server has not started inside the container. In this case, see Viewing Che workspaces logs. Procedure To check the feature flags: Check if the features are enabled. The YAML plug-in provides multiple settings that can enable and disable features, such as: yaml.format.enable: Enables the formatter yaml.validate: Enables validation yaml.hover: Enables the hover function yaml.completion: Enables the completion function To check if the plug-in is working, type the simplest YAML, such as hello: world, and then open the Outline panel on the right side of the editor. Verify if there are any document symbols. If yes, the language server is connected to the editor. If any feature is not working, verify that the settings listed above are set to true (they are set to true by default). If a feature is not working, file an issue against the Language Server. Procedure To log LSP messages to the Visual Studio Code Output view, enable tracing by setting the yaml.trace.server attribute to verbose. Che uses the OmniSharp-Theia plug-in as a remote plug-in. It is located at github.com/redhat-developer/omnisharp-theia-plugin. In case of an issue, report it, or contribute your fix in the repository. This plug-in registers omnisharp-roslyn as a language server and provides project dependencies and language syntax for C# applications. The language server runs on .NET SDK 2.2.105. Procedure To check if the container running the OmniSharp-Theia plug-in is running OmniSharp, execute the ps aux | grep OmniSharp.exe command. If the process is running, the following is an example output: /tmp/theia-unpacked/redhat-developer.che-omnisharp-plugin.0.0.1.zcpaqpczwb.omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia/server/bin/mono /tmp/theia-unpacked/redhat-developer.che-omnisharp-plugin.0.0.1.zcpaqpczwb.omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia/server/omnisharp/OmniSharp.exe If the output is different, the language server has not started inside the container. Check the logs described in Viewing Che workspaces logs. Procedure If the OmniSharp.exe process is running, check if the language server features are working by opening a .cs file and trying the hover or completion features, or opening the Problems or Outline view. Procedure If OmniSharp.exe is running, it logs all information in the Output panel. To view the logs, open the Output view and select C# from the drop-down list. The NetcoredebugOutput plug-in provides the netcoredbg tool. This tool implements the Visual Studio Code Debug Adapter protocol and allows users to debug .NET applications under the .NET Core runtime. The container where the NetcoredebugOutput plug-in is running contains .NET SDK v.2.2.105. Procedure Search for a netcoredbg debug configuration in the launch.json file. Example 1. Sample debug configuration { \"type\": \"netcoredbg\", \"request\": \"launch\", \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug//\", \"args\": [], \"name\": \".NET Core Launch (console)\", \"stopAtEntry\": false, \"console\": \"internalConsole\" } Test the autocompletion feature within the braces of the configuration section of the launch.json file. If you can find netcoredbg, the Che-Theia plug-in is correctly initialized. If not, see Viewing Che workspaces logs. This section describes how to view NetcoredebugOutput plug-in logs in the Output panel. Procedure Open the Debug console. Procedure The user can inspect the log output of the sidecar container using the Camel language tools that are stored in the vscode-apache-camel Camel container. To verify the state of the language server: Open a terminal inside the vscode-apache-camel container. Run the ps aux | grep java command. The following is an example language server process: java -jar /tmp/vscode-unpacked/camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel.latest.euqhbmepxd.camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel-0.0.14.vsix/extension/jars/language-server.jar If you cannot find it, see Viewing Che workspaces logs. The Camel language server is a SpringBoot application that writes its log to the $\\{java.io.tmpdir}/log-camel-lsp.out file. Typically, $\\{java.io.tmpdir} points to the /tmp directory, so the filename is /tmp/log-camel-lsp.out. Procedure The Camel language server logs are printed in the Output channel named Language Support for Apache Camel. The output channel is created only at the first created log entry on the client side. It may be absent when everything is going well. This section describes how to view Che-Theia IDE logs. Observing Che-Theia editor logs helps to get a better understanding and insight over the plug-ins loaded by the editor. This section describes how to access the Che-Theia editor logs using the OpenShift CLI (command-line interface). Prerequisites Che is deployed in an OpenShift cluster. A workspace is created.

This can mean always returning true, or have more complex checks, for example, returning false when a connection property is missing. destroy() - cleanup method that is run before shutting down the telemetry backend. This method sends the WORKSPACE_STOPPED event. onActivity() - notifies that some activity is still happening for a given user. This is mainly used to send WORKSPACE_INACTIVE events. onEvent() - submits telemetry events to the telemetry server, such as WORKSPACE_USED or WORKSPACE_STARTED. increaseDuration() - increases the duration of a current event rather than sending many events in a small frame of time. The following sections cover: Creating a telemetry server to echo events to standard output. Extending the Che telemetry client and implementing a user’s custom backend. Creating a plugin.yaml file representing a DevWorkspace plug-in for the custom backend. Specifying of a location of a custom plug-in to Che by setting the workspacesDefaultPlugins attribute from the CheCluster custom resource. This document describes the steps required to extend the Che telemetry system to communicate with to a custom backend: Creating a server process that receives events Extending Che libraries to create a backend that sends events to the server Packaging the telemetry backend in a container and deploying it to an image registry Adding a plug-in for your backend and instructing Che to load the plug-in in your DevWorkspaces A finished example of the telemetry backend is available here. For demonstration purposes, this example shows how to create a server that receives events from our telemetry plug-in and writes them to standard output. For production use cases, consider integrating with a third-party telemetry system (for example, Segment, Woopra) rather than creating your own telemetry server. In this case, use your provider’s APIs to send events from your custom backend to their system. The following Go code starts a server on port 8080 and writes events to standard output: Example 1. main.go package main import ( \"io/ioutil\" \"net/http\" \"go.uber.org/zap\" ) var logger *zap.SugaredLogger func event(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /event\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /event\") } body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"err\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got event\") } func activity(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /activity, doing nothing\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /activity\") body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got activity\") } } func main() { log, _ := zap.NewProduction() logger = log.Sugar() http.HandleFunc(\"/event\", event) http.HandleFunc(\"/activity\", activity) logger.Info(\"Added Handlers\") logger.Info(\"Starting to serve\") http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil) } Create a container image based on this code and expose it as a deployment in OpenShift in the eclipse-che namespace. The code for the example telemetry server is available at telemetry-server-example. To deploy the telemetry server, clone the repository and build the container: $ git clone https://github.com/che-incubator/telemetry-server-example $ cd telemetry-server-example $ docker build -t registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest . $ docker push registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest Both manifest_with_ingress.yaml and manifest_with_route contain definitions for a Deployment and Service. The former also defines a Kubernetes Ingress, while the latter defines an OpenShift Route. In the manifest file, replace the image and host fields to match the image you pushed, and the public hostname of your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Then run: $ kubectl apply -f manifest_with_[ingress|route].yaml -n {prod-namespace} For fast feedback when developing, it is recommended to do development inside a DevWorkspace. This way, you can run the application in a cluster and receive events from the front-end telemetry plug-in.

AnalyticsManager.java - contains logic specific to the telemetry system. Example 4. MainConfiguration.java package org.my.group; import java.util.Optional; import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent; import javax.enterprise.inject.Alternative; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.BaseConfiguration; import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty; @Dependent @Alternative public class MainConfiguration extends BaseConfiguration { @ConfigProperty(name = \"welcome.message\") (1) Optional welcomeMessage; (2) } 1 A MicroProfile configuration annotation is used to inject the welcome.message configuration. For more details on how to set configuration properties specific to your backend, see the Quarkus Configuration Reference Guide. Example 5. AnalyticsManager.java package org.my.group; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent; import javax.enterprise.inject.Alternative; import javax.inject.Inject; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.AbstractAnalyticsManager; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.AnalyticsEvent; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.finder.DevWorkspaceFinder; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.finder.UsernameFinder; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RestClient; import org.slf4j.Logger; import static org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger; @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { private static final Logger LOG = getLogger(AbstractAnalyticsManager.class); public AnalyticsManager(MainConfiguration mainConfiguration, DevWorkspaceFinder devworkspaceFinder, UsernameFinder usernameFinder) { super(mainConfiguration, devworkspaceFinder, usernameFinder); mainConfiguration.welcomeMessage.ifPresentOrElse( (1) (str) -> LOG.info(\"The welcome message is: {}\", str), () -> LOG.info(\"No welcome message provided\") ); } @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } @Override public void destroy() {} @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map properties) { LOG.info(\"The received event is: {}\", event); (2) } @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map properties) { } @Override public void onActivity() {} } 1 Log the welcome message if it was provided. 2 Log the event received from the front-end plug-in. Since org.my.group.AnalyticsManager and org.my.group.MainConfiguration are alternative beans, specify them using the quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives property in src/main/resources/application.properties. Example 6. application.properties quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives=MainConfiguration,AnalyticsManager Set the DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT environment variable in the DevWorkspace. Here, the value is set to 4167. spec: template: attributes: workspaceEnv: - name: DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT value: '4167' Restart the DevWorkspace from the Eclipse Che dashboard. Run the following command within a DevWorkspace’s terminal window to start the application. Use the --settings flag to specify path to the location of the settings.xml file that contains the GitHub access token. $ mvn --settings=settings.xml quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=${DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT} The application now receives telemetry events through port 4167 from the front-end plug-in. Verification steps Verify that the following output is logged: INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (Quarkus Main Thread) No welcome message provided INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) devworkspace-telemetry-example-plugin 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.7.2.Final) started in 0.323s.

The following output should be logged: INFO [io.qua.dep.dev.RuntimeUpdatesProcessor] (Aesh InputStream Reader) Live reload disabled INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (executor-thread-2) The received event is: Edit Workspace File in Che For the purposes of the example, this method always returns true whenever it is called. Example 7. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } It is possible to put more complex logic in isEnabled(). For example, the hosted Che Woopra backend checks that a configuration property exists before determining if the backend is enabled. onEvent() sends the event received by the backend to the telemetry system. For the example application, it sends an HTTP POST payload to the /event endpoint from the telemetry server. For the following example, the telemetry server application is deployed to OpenShift at the following URL: http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing, where apps-crc.testing is the ingress domain name of the OpenShift cluster. Set up the RESTEasy REST Client by creating TelemetryService.java Example 8. TelemetryService.java package org.my.group; import java.util.Map; import javax.ws.rs.Consumes; import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType; import javax.ws.rs.core.Response; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient; @RegisterRestClient public interface TelemetryService { @POST @Path(\"/event\") (1) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) Response sendEvent(Map payload); } 1 The endpoint to make the POST request to. Specify the base URL for TelemetryService in the src/main/resources/application.properties file: Example 9. application.properties org.my.group.TelemetryService/mp-rest/url=http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing Inject TelemetryService into AnalyticsManager and send a POST request in onEvent() Example 10. AnalyticsManager.java @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { @Inject @RestClient TelemetryService telemetryService; ... @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map properties) { Map payload = new HashMap(properties); payload.put(\"event\", event); telemetryService.sendEvent(payload); } This sends an HTTP request to the telemetry server and automatically delays identical events for a small period of time. The default duration is 1500 milliseconds. Many telemetry systems recognize event duration. The AbstractAnalyticsManager merges similar events that happen in the same frame of time into one event. This implementation of increaseDuration() is a no-op. This method uses the APIs of the user’s telemetry provider to alter the event or event properties to reflect the increased duration of an event. Example 11. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map properties) {} Set an inactive timeout limit, and use onActivity() to send a WORKSPACE_INACTIVE event if the last event time is longer than the timeout. Example 12. AnalyticsManager.java public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { ... private long inactiveTimeLimit = 60000 * 3; ... @Override public void onActivity() { if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastEventTime >= inactiveTimeLimit) { onEvent(WORKSPACE_INACTIVE, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } } When destroy() is called, send a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event and shutdown any resources such as connection pools. Example 13. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void destroy() { onEvent(WORKSPACE_STOPPED, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } Running mvn quarkus:dev as described in Running the application within a DevWorkspace and terminating the application with Ctrl+C sends a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event to the server. See the Quarkus documentation for the best instructions to package the application in a container. Build and push the container to a container registry of your choice. Example 14.

Typically, the user deploys this file to a corporate web server. This guide demonstrates how to create an Apache web server on OpenShift and host the plug-in there. Create a ConfigMap referencing the new plugin.yaml file. $ oc create configmap --from-file=plugin.yaml -n eclipse-che telemetry-plugin-yaml Create a deployment, a service, and a route to expose the web server.

Create a GitHub personal access token with read:packages permissions and copy the token value. This token is used to access GitHub packages to download the Che telemetry library.

When running locally, add the information to your personal settings.xml file. Run and test the application is in a Che workspace: $ mvn quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=${CHE_WORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT} If Che is secured using a self-signed certificate, add the certificate to a trust store and mount it into the workspace. Also add the Java system property, -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/trustStore, to the mvn command. For example, assuming the trust store is located in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts: $ keytool -import -alias self-signed-certificate \\ -file -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts Followed by: $ mvn quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=${CHE_WORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT} \\ -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts Create two new files in your project: AnalyticsManager.java - contains the logic specific to the telemetry system. MainConfiguration.java - is the main entrypoint that creates an instance of AnalyticsManager and starts listening for events. Example 4. AnalyticsManager.java package org.my.group; import java.util.Map; import org.eclipse.che.api.core.rest.HttpJsonRequestFactory; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.AbstractAnalyticsManager; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.AnalyticsEvent; public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { public AnalyticsManager(String apiEndpoint, String workspaceId, String machineToken, HttpJsonRequestFactory requestFactory) { super(apiEndpoint, workspaceId, machineToken, requestFactory); } @Override public boolean isEnabled() { // TODO Auto-generated method stub return true; } @Override public void destroy() { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map properties) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map properties) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } @Override public void onActivity() { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } } Example 5.

Whenever the server is running, it is enabled and operational. Example 6. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } It is possible to put more a complex login in isEnabled(). For example, the service should not be considered operational in certain cases. The hosted Che Woopra backend checks that a configuration property exists before determining if the backend is enabled. onEvent() sends the event passed to the backend to the telemetry system. For the example application, it sends an HTTP POST payload to the telemetry server. The example telemetry server application is deployed to OpenShift at the following URL: http://little-telemetry-backend-che.apps-crc.testing. Example 7. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map properties) { HttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault(); HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(\"http://little-telemetry-backend-che.apps-crc.testing/event\"); HashMap eventPayload = new HashMap(properties); eventPayload.put(\"event\", event); StringEntity requestEntity = new StringEntity(new JsonObject(eventPayload).toString(), ContentType.APPLICATION_JSON); httpPost.setEntity(requestEntity); try { HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpPost); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } This sends an HTTP request to the telemetry server and automatically delays identical events for a small period of time. The default duration is 1500 milliseconds. You can modify the duration by setting subclasses. Many telemetry systems recognize event duration. The AbstractAnalyticsManager merges similar events that happen in the same frame of time into one event. This implementation of increaseDuration() is a no-op. This method uses the APIs of the user’s telemetry provider to alter the event or event properties to reflect the increased duration of an event. Example 8. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map properties) {} Set an inactive timeout limit, and use onActivity() to send a WORKSPACE_INACTIVE event if the last event time is longer than the inactivity timeout. Example 9. AnalyticsManager.java public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { ... private long inactiveTimeLimt = 60000 * 3; ... @Override public void onActivity() { if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastEventTime >= inactiveTimeLimt) { onEvent(WORKSPACE_INACTIVE, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } } When destroy() is called, send a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event and shutdown any resources, such as connection pools. Example 10. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void destroy() { onEvent(WORKSPACE_STOPPED, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } Running mvn quarkus:dev as described in Running the application displays the WORKSPACE_STOPPED event, sent to the server when the Quarkus application is terminated. See the quarkus documentation for the best instructions to package the application in a container. Build and push the container to a container registry of your choice. Create a meta.yaml definition representing a Che plug-in that runs your custom backend in a workspace Pod. Example 11. meta.yaml apiVersion: v2 publisher: demo-publisher name: little-telemetry-backend version: 0.0.1 type: Che Plugin displayName: Little Telemetry Backend description: A Demo telemetry backend title: Little Telemetry Backend category: Other spec: workspaceEnv: - name: CHE_WORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT value: '4167' containers: - name: YOUR BACKEND NAME image: YOUR IMAGE NAME env: - name: CHE_API value: $(CHE_API_INTERNAL) Typically, the user deploys this file to a corporate web server. This guide demonstrates how to create an Apache web server on OpenShift and host the plug-in there. Create a ConfigMap referencing the new meta.yaml file. $ oc create configmap --from-file=meta.yaml -n eclipse-che telemetry-plugin-meta Create a deployment, a service, and a route to expose the web server. The deployment references this ConfigMap and places it in the /var/www/html directory. Example 12. manifests.yaml kind: Deployment apiVersion: apps/v1 metadata: name: apache namespace: spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: apache template: metadata: labels: app: apache spec: volumes: - name: plugin-meta-yaml configMap: name: telemetry-plugin-meta defaultMode: 420 containers: - name: apache image: 'registry.redhat.io/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:latest' ports: - containerPort: 8080 protocol: TCP resources: {} volumeMounts: - name: plugin-meta-yaml mountPath: /var/www/html strategy: type: RollingUpdate rollingUpdate: maxUnavailable: 25% maxSurge: 25% revisionHistoryLimit: 10 progressDeadlineSeconds: 600 --- kind: Service apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: apache namespace: spec: ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 selector: app: apache type: ClusterIP --- kind: Route apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1 metadata: name: apache namespace: spec: host: apache-che.apps-crc.testing to: kind: Service name: apache weight: 100 port: targetPort: 8080 wildcardPolicy: None $ oc apply -f manifests.yaml Wait a few minutes for the image to pull and the deployment to start, and then confirm that meta.yaml is available in the web server: $ curl apache-che.apps-crc.testing/meta.yaml This command should return the meta.yaml file. Update the CheCluster Custom Resource, and add the CHE_WORKSPACE_DEVFILE_DEFAULT__EDITOR_PLUGINS environment variable to spec.server.customCheProperties. The value of the environment variable must be the URL of the location of the meta.yaml file on your web server. This can be accomplished by running oc edit checluster -n eclipse-che and typing in the change at the terminal, or by editing the CR in the OpenShift console (Installed Operators → Eclipse Che → Eclipse Che Cluster → eclipse-che → YAML).

By default, telemetry is not available in Eclipse Che, but there is an abstract API that allows enabling telemetry using the plug-in mechanism. This approach is used in the Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat service where telemetry is enabled for every workspace. This documentation includes a guide describing how to make your own telemetry client for Eclipse Che, followed by an overview of the Eclipse Che Woopra Telemetry Plugin. Eclipse Che telemetry API allows tracking: Duration of a workspace utilization User-driven actions such as file editing, committing, and pushing to remote repositories. The list of plug-ins enabled in a workspace Programming languages and devfiles used in workspaces. When a Che workspace starts, the che-theia container starts the telemetry plug-in, which is responsible for sending telemetry events to a backend. If the $CHE_WORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT environment variable was set in the workspace Pod, the telemetry plug-in will send events to a backend listening at that port. If the Che workspace has a telemetry back-end container running, and it is listening on $CHE_WORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT, it takes the events sent from the telemetry plug-in, turns them into the backend-specific representation of events, and sends them to the configured analytics backend (for example, Segment or Woopra). Telemetry for DevWorkspaces works similarly to telemetry for Che workspaces, with the main differences being: A DevWorkspace telemetry plug-in listens for events on $DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT instead of $CHE_WORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT. The DevWorkspace telemetry plug-in requires version 0.0.34 or later of the telemetry plug-in dependency.

Eclipse Che A developer platform for the cloud that provides an in-browser IDE. Che tools can be extended by adding development services, such as language servers, debug adapters, or editors (IDEs) packaged as containers. Che-Theia The default editor component of a Che workspace. It is a Che-specific customization of the Eclipse Theia editor. Che-Theia can be extended using Che-Theia plug-ins, which are packaged as containers for ease of deployment and use. Che-Theia plug-ins are usually compatible with Visual Studio extensions. Che Workspace A container-based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every Che workspace is defined by a devfile. A Che workspace is composed of an editor, runtime and build containers and other development tools running inside containers. Editor A web application that is used as an editor in a workspace. Plugin Plug-ins are services that extend Che workspace capabilities. Che plug-ins are packaged as containers. plug-ins are extensions of an editor or a service running in the container. For example, the Che-Theia editor is compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. Both Che plug-ins and editors are distributed through the Che plug-ins registry. Workspace A container-based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every Che workspace is defined by a devfile. A Che workspace can be composed by an editor, some plug-ins and runtime containers. Workspace runtime containers can be defined as simple container images or as Kubernetes or OpenShift resources. A Che Workspace can be associated with source code projects hosted on a remote CVS server. A Che Workspace can contain the definition of one or more commands such as run, build, or debug. Devfile A workspace configuration template. Devfiles are used to create workspaces in the Dashboard. A devfile includes metadata such as scope, tags, components, description, name, and identification. Visual Studio Code API is one of the plug-in APIs that can be used in Theia. Factory A template that contains the configuration to automate the generation of a new workspace using a factory identifier or a devfile added to the URL of the IDE.

Weekly meetings Join us in the Che community meeting every Monday. Roadmap See the development roadmap on the wiki. Eclipse Che is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform. As an open source project, the core goals of Eclipse Che are to: Accelerate project and developer onboarding: As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, Eclipse Che makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project. Remove inconsistency between developer environments: No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment. Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness: As Eclipse Che becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines. To achieve those core goals, Eclipse Che provides: Workspaces: Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications. Browser-based IDEs: Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tools, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more. Extensible platform: Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. Enterprise Integration: Multiuser capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD. Che defines the workspace to be the project code files and all the dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Che treats the IDE and the development runtime as dependencies of the workspace. These items are embedded and always included with the workspace. This differentiates Che from classical workspace definitions, which may include the project code, but require the developer to bind their IDE to their workstation and use it to provide a runtime locally. Workspaces are isolated from one another and are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their components. Developers using Eclipse Che use their containers directly in their developer workspaces. Che workspaces are Kubernetes or OpenShift Pods, which allow to replicate the application runtimes (and its microservices) used in production and provide a “developer mode” layer on top of those, adding intelligent code completion and IDE tools. Eclipse Che provides browser-based IDEs for its workspaces. The default IDE is built on Theia, and it has the following capabilities: Monaco-based editor: A fast and responsive editor, CodeLens Language Server Protocol: Language tools Debug Adapter Protocol: Debugger tools Command palette: Do everything from your keyboard Task support: Tasks from Visual Studio Code are extended and support Che commands Embedded preview: Preview your application directly from the IDE, including Markdown preview Customizable layout: Adapt the layout using drag-and-drop And more: Outline view, search, Git In Eclipse Che, the IDE is completely decoupled, so that it is possible to plug a different IDE into Che workspaces: It can be based on Eclipse Theia (as it is a framework to build a web IDE), such as Sirius: It can be a completely different solution, such as Jupyter or Eclipse Dirigible: For situations where the default IDE does not cover the use cases of the users or to use a dedicated tool rather than an IDE. Eclipse Che is a great platform to build cloud-native tools, and it provides a strong extensibility model with an enjoyable developer experience for contributors. Eclipse Che is extensible in different ways: Plug-ins to add capabilities to the IDE. Che-Theia plug-ins rely on APIs compatible with Visual Studio Code. Plug-ins are isolated and provide their own dependencies packaged in containers. Stacks to create pre-configured Che workspaces with a dedicated set of tools. Alternative IDEs to provide specialized tools within Eclipse Che. Build your own, based on Eclipse Theia, or pick existing ones such as Jupyter. Marketplace (soon) to easily distribute tools and custom IDEs, which can be tried online, to users and communities. Eclipse Che uses Che-Theia as its default browser-based IDE. Che-Theia provides a framework to build web IDEs. It is built-in TypeScript and gives contributors a programming model that is flexible, relies on state-of-the-art tools protocols, and makes it faster to build new tools. In Eclipse Che, the dependencies needed for the tools running in the user’s workspace are available when needed. This means that a Che-Theia plug-in provides its dependencies, its back-end services (which could be running in a sidecar container connected to the user’s workspace), and the IDE UI extension. Che packages all these elements together, so that the user does not have to configure different tools together. Eclipse Che rationalizes the effort for a contributor who wants to build a plug-in and distribute it to different developer communities and tools. For that purpose, Eclipse Che features a plug-in API compatible with extension points from Visual Studio Code. As a result, it is easy to bring an existing plug-in from Visual Studio Code into Eclipse Che. The main difference is in the way the plug-ins are packaged. On Eclipse Che, plug-ins are delivered with their own dependencies in their own container. Eclipse Che includes Keycloak to handle authentication and security. It allows integration with any single sign-on (SSO), and with Active Directory or LDAP. Every Eclipse Che user gets a centralized developer workspace that can be easily defined, administered, and managed. As a Kubernetes-native application, Eclipse Che provides state-of-the-art monitoring and tracing capabilities, integrating with Prometheus and Grafana.
